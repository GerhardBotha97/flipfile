1. Install needed packages:

pip3 install openpyxl fpdf python-docx

2. In main.py, change the following:
    - replacement_string (change to something you want the files to say).
    - urls array (change to urls ending in an file ext with png,jpg,jpeg,gif,svg)

3. Save the file.

4. Run `python3 main.py`.

5. You will (hopefully) have a list of file in the output directory that you can use to test for file upload vulnerabilities.
